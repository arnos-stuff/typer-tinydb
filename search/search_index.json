Here's a short introduction about me: What I do I'm currently working as a junior IT & Data Consultant somewhere in the very pretty business hub of La D\u00e9fense , but I'm also trying to learn a bit more about programming and web development. I'm a self-anointed pythonista \ud83d\udc0d, but I'm trying to learn Julia & Javascript aswell ! I also work a lot with SQL at my current job, though I'm eyeing on the recent trends like Snowflake and BigQuery \ud83d\udc40. Here's a picture of my workplace (and some others I took in the area ): What I'm working on I'm currently working on a few projects, but I'm not sure I'll be able to finish them anytime soon. I'm also trying to learn a bit more about web development, so I'm trying to make a few websites. Here's a list of the projects I'm currently working on: Number Language Description 1 \ud83d\udc0d A few unpolished python packages 2 \ud83d\udc0d A python data API for eurostat related data 3 JS A Vue.js website to slowly learn Vue.js 4 \ud83e\udd13 A small blog about math related topics when I feel like talking theory That's a lot ! But I also have some personnal matters ... The personal stuff I'm Autistic & Queer I'm a proud Aspie / Neurodivergent person , I received an official diagnosis from H\u00f4pital Saint-Anne in Paris, France a year or so ago. They're considered a bit competent on the topic so I trust them. I'm also most probably trans \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f, but I'm not sure 100% yet. I'm currently trying to figure out how to go about it, the process is a bit complicated in France, but it's a work in progress. I wrote a short piece about the relationship between autism and gender diversity a while back. I like games I'm also a big video game player, so maybe we can play together sometime ! I'm currently a bit busy with work, but I'd love to share some factoids about my favorite games. I like music I'm a HUGE music nerd, just to name a few of my favorite genres: Genre Description 70's rock especially progressive rock and Cantebury scene / Krautrock bands Bebop and Hard-Bop The golden age of Bebop and Hard-Bop, especially the work of Miles Davis, who helped me bridge the gap between Jazz and Rock (I'm a huge fan of his work with John McLaughlin) IDM Especially the work of \u03bc-Ziq, Floating Points, Squarepusher, and Boards of Canada Hip-Hop The classics, especially the work of MF Doom, Madlib, and J Dilla Hyperpop I'm a huge fan of the work of Charli XCX ! K-pop I've recently discovered I like K-pop thanks to League of Legends' KDA group, and I'm slowly getting into the genre .. Metal I love Gojira obviously, but a lot of artists here and there, the progressive Metal scene is pretty dope aswell \ud83e\udd29 ... and many more \ud83c\udfb5 I like math I'm also a big math nerd, I'm currently trying to learn a bit more about statistics and probability theory, as I'm a recovering tentative PhD grad (I worked on Causal Inference back in Shanghai ).
