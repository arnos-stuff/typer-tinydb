# Versions and notable updates

# First release 0.1.1

Barebones functionality, get-set-list, and no documentation

# Patch 0.1.2

Added a more documented and cleaner codebase, still few features, but a great improvement docs-wise
with the adoption of [mkdocs][1] and [mike][2].

# Patch 0.1.3 [LATEST]

added the ability for users to create their own tables from the CLI, added dedicated commands `uset` and `uget`
for user-defined tables. Added a fair amount of aliases aswell, with `+` meaning `set` (and `++` for `uset`) and `?` meaning `get`.

Added the fairly [helpful tool `mkgendoc`][3] to generate content for the "library" part of the package.
