# Hi üëã, I'm Arno!

Here's a short introduction about me:

## What I do

I'm currently working as a junior IT & Data Consultant somewhere in the [very pretty][2] business hub of [La D√©fense][1], but I'm also trying to learn a bit more about programming and web development. I'm a self-anointed pythonista üêç, but I'm trying to learn Julia & Javascript aswell !  

I also work a lot with [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) at my current job, though I'm eyeing on the recent trends like [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) and [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) üëÄ.

Here's a picture of my workplace (and [some others I took in the area][3]):

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on a few projects, but I'm not sure I'll be able to finish them anytime soon. I'm also trying to learn a bit more about web development, so I'm trying to make a few websites. Here's a list of the projects I'm currently working on:

| Number | Language | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | üêç | A few unpolished [python packages](https://pypi.org/user/arnos-stuff/) |
| 2 | üêç | A python [data API for eurostat related data](https://api.arnov.dev/) |
| 3 | JS | A [Vue.js website](https://vue.arnov.dev/) to slowly learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) |
| 4 | ü§ì | A small [blog about math related topics][5] when I feel like talking theory |


That's a lot ! But I also have some personnal matters ...

# The personal stuff

## I'm Autistic & Queer

I'm a proud [Aspie / Neurodivergent person][4], I received an official diagnosis from [H√¥pital Saint-Anne](https://www.hopital-saint-anne.fr/) in Paris, France a year or so ago. They're considered a bit competent on the topic so I trust them.

I'm also most probably trans üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è, but I'm not sure 100% yet. I'm currently trying to figure out how to go about it, the process is a bit complicated in France, but it's a work in progress.

I wrote a short piece about the [relationship between autism and gender diversity][6] a while back.

## I like games

I'm also a big video game player, so maybe we can play together sometime ! I'm currently a bit busy with work, but I'd love to share some factoids about my favorite games.

## I like music

I'm a HUGE music nerd, just to name a few of my favorite genres:

| Genre | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 70's rock | especially progressive rock and Cantebury scene / Krautrock bands |
| Bebop and Hard-Bop | The golden age of Bebop and Hard-Bop, especially the work of Miles Davis, who helped me bridge the gap between Jazz and Rock (I'm a huge fan of his work with John McLaughlin) |
| IDM | Especially the work of Œº-Ziq, Floating Points, Squarepusher, and Boards of Canada |
| Hip-Hop | The classics, especially the work of MF Doom, Madlib, and J Dilla |
| Hyperpop | I'm a huge fan of the work of Charli XCX ! |
| K-pop | I've recently discovered I like K-pop thanks to League of Legends' KDA group, and I'm slowly getting into the genre  .. |
| Metal | I love Gojira obviously, but a lot of artists here and there, the progressive Metal scene is pretty dope aswell ü§© |

... and many more üéµ

## I like math

I'm also a big math nerd, I'm currently trying to learn a bit more about statistics and probability theory, as I'm a recovering tentative PhD grad (I worked on [Causal Inference][7] back in [Shanghai][8]).

I'd love learning more, but I'm busy and already have a lot to do !
